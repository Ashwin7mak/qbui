##Overview:
Appium is an open-source tool for automating mobile web on iOS and Android platforms. Mobile web apps are web apps accessed using a mobile browser (Appium supports Safari on iOS and Chrome or the built-in ‘Browser’ app on Android).

For more info on Appium please see their website here: [http://appium.io/getting-started.html?lang=en)].

##Configuration:
go to qbui/ui and run npm install. This should install appium version 1.6.4 and appium-service 0.2.3
run sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app in the terminal
First copy the checked in **sample** file to the same directory renaming it to **wdio.conf.js** to create your local config (this has already been added to **.gitignore**). The sample file is located in

`qbui/ui/wdio/config/wdioMobile.conf.js.sample`

This config file will be set by default to run your tests locally. The config file will read in environment variables set by your Node server.
By default the E2E tests will launch a **separate** Node server automatically using the **e2e.js** config file on port **9001** (aka **NODE_ENV=e2e** environment variable if you run from the command line).
This is to prevent port collision if you have Node already running. This also loads appium server by default listening to 0.0.0.0:4723. This service is started before test run and stopped after the tests are run.

###Choosing which tests run:
Edit the **specs** parameter of **wdio.conf.js** (the path is dependent on where u run the wdio.conf.js from - see above).If all above works good the checkpoint is the test './ui/wdio/tests/reports/reportTable.e2e.spec.js' should 100% pass on iPad2(tablet)
and './ui/wdio/tests/mobile/reportSortingViaContainer.e2e.spec.js' should work on iPhone(card view)

##Troubleshooting:
Please make sure xCode 7.2 is installed
