## Start Node Server :
### using _grunt_ to build and start node server and  watch for changes
* From command window:
    * cd to the ui folder
    * run `grunt serve` (looks for local.js) or `NODE_ENV=local grunt serve` or `NODE_ENV=local CLIENT=REACT grunt serve`.  
    * grunt will generate the client webpack output
    * browser should open to default client home page
    * grunt will wait for changes to client or server and regen webpack and restart server
    
### Or using _npm_ to build and start server only
* From command window:
     * cd to the ui folder
     * run  `npm run webpack` 
     * then `NODE_ENV=local npm start`
     * if your local has noHotLoad:true it will not hotload, it will hotload client files by default
     * grunt will generate the client webpack output
     * manually go to browser at localhost:9000

## Generate distribution(dist) folder for production deploy
* From command window:    
    * run  `NODE_ENV=prod grunt build`
    * to generate the ui/dist folder for deploy 
        * which will contain the server dir and
        * public/dist dir with the react and client bundle files 
    * run NODE_ENV=prod server/app from ui/dist  for prod react interface 
     
## Run Unit tests with Karma:
* From command window:
     * cd to the ui folder
     * run `grunt test` or `npm run tests` 
     * output is sent to:
        * the console 
        * ui/build/reports/client/unit/client_report.xml 
         
#WebPack 

## What gets generated 
* webpack builds the client files (replaces bower/browserify)
* build output to /client-react/dist folder
* non-production build outputs bundle.js and bundle.js.map
* production build outputs bundle.min.js and bundle.min.js.map

## Developers to run react app with _hot load_ of ui changes
_note: hot loading means edits will update the browser without needing to refresh the page
### Using _npm_ to launch hot reload node server
* From command window:    
    * run  `NODE_ENV=local npm start` 
    * if your local config does not have noHotLoad:true it will hotload client files by default    
    * manually go to browser at localhost:9000
    * any edits you make to the files in the bundle (css, js) will be hot loaded 
    
you can also create a node.js config in intellij to debug the server
