/**
 * A parent component which orchestrates sliding a drawer in and out of the parent container.
 * We rely on React Router 4's children function, see https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route/children-func
 *
 * While the drawerContainer div is visible, the user cannot click on the root record because it's blocked by the
 * invisible backdrop.
 *
 * Lifecycle of this component:                                    match  state.visible  <div drawerContainer>  <Drawer>
 * 1> initial render                                             | -----  -------------  ---------------------  --------
 *    render an invisible <div className="drawerContainer"> with | false      false              hidden           null
 *    <ReactCSSTransitionGroup> as an inner child.               |
 *    ReactCSSTransitionGroup is invisible because the parent    |
 *    node, drawerContainer, has display:none                    |
 *
 * 2> slide the drawer in                                        | true       true              visible         rendered
 *    when a route change dictates that we need to render a      |
 *    drawer, we make drawerContainer visible using              |
 *    setState({visible: true}) which is called by the child     |
 *    drawer during its componentWillMount.                      |
 *    The drawer will slide in.                                  |
 *
 * 3> slide the drawer out                                       | false      true              visible         rendered
 *    When match is null, we will attempt to remove the inner    |
 *    drawer.                                                    |
 *    ReactCSSTransitionGroup will transition the inner drawer   |
 *    off screen.                                                |
 *    The drawer is still visible (off screen) drawerContainer   |
 *    is also still visible because this.state.visible is true.  |
 *
 * 4> ReactCSSTransitionGroup unmounts the drawer                | false      true              hidden           null
 *    drawer component will call ComponentWillUnmount, which     |
 *    calls hideDrawerContainer. DrawerContainer sets            |
 *    visibility to false.                                       |
 *    Now the drawerContainer is invisible and the user's clicks |
 *    will reach the root record.
 *
 * We do all this shenanigan because we need ReactCSSTransitionGroup visible at step (3), and invisible at (1) and (4).
 * If we don't use this.state.visible and only rely on `match`, ReactCSSTransitionGroup will be hidden at (3), which
 * means there will be no transition for the drawer sliding out.
