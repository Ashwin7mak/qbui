#Environment Configuration

Temporary changes to support a new 'REACT' run-time environment.  These changes to be deleted once the Angular client code is removed.

* /server/config/environment/react.js : new file created to configure a 'REACT' run time environment.
* /server/config/environment/environmentConstants.js : added 'REACT' run time environment 
* /server/config/expressConfig.js : define static appPath for the 'REACT' run time environment.  
* /server/routes/js : load either Angular or React routes based on run-time environment.
 
#package.json   
 
Updated to include React modules.  When Angular is removed, will need to do the following:

* Remove all Angular references from dev and devDependencies section
* Update webpack script to reference where the webpack configuration file is located (client-react will probably be refactored to just client..)
