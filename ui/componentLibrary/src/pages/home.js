            <h3>What is a design system?</h3>

            <p>In a nutshell, a design system is a resource. It helps design and development teams create something big, (one small piece at a time). It guides teams so that they understand how the product theyâ€™re building is intended to look and behave. Colors, Typography, & Icons are a few common basics.</p>

            <h3>Why does it matter?</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Promote shared understanding</li>
                <li>Make decisions faster</li>
                <li>Showcase what exists today</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
